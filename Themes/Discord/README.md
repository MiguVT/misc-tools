# ClearVision Discord Theme

This is a custom theme for Discord that enhances the user interface and provides a unique look and feel, based on [ClearVision](https://clearvision.gitlab.io/).

## Installation

Can be found in the [Original ClearVision Repository README](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v7?tab=readme-ov-file#installing), just instead of using the original theme file, use [This One](./YaraVision.css).

## Features

- Improved color scheme
- Teto background (One of my favorites Vocaloid characters)
- Outlined discord logo in the top left corner
- Modified with <3 by MiguVT
