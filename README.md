# MiguVT's Miscellaneous Tools

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of small tools, scripts and themes developed by MiguVT (or modifications of existing themes) for various purposes. These tools are not part of any larger project and are provided as-is.

## Tools

- [**Discord Theme**](/Themes/Discord/): A custom theme for Discord that enhances the user interface and provides a unique look and feel, based on [ClearVision](https://clearvision.gitlab.io/).
- [**fixvr**](/VR/fixvr/): Automates the headset restart process using lighthouse_console, so you don't have to depend on the full SteamVR interface.
- [**OpenWRT**](/OpenWRT/): This folder contains configuration files I use for building my custom OpenWRT image for my **BPI-R4 router**.
- [**Hagezi**](/Hagezi/): Downloads and merges HaGeZi DNS blocklists into a single file for Technitium DNS.

## Usage
