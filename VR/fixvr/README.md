# Fix DRM Issues with PCVR
Remember that times when on linux you had to enter SteamVR and click "Restart Headset" or take the headset unplug that cable and plug again for making DRM work, this script just do the "Restart Headset" thing without depending fully on SteamVR (You only need the lighthouse_console)
